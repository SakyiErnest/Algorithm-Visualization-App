## üîÑ Algorithms Explained

### Sorting Algorithms

1. **Merge Sort**

   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)
   - Type: Divide and Conquer

2. **Quick Sort**

   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) average, O(n¬≤) worst
   - Space Complexity: O(log n)
   - Type: Divide and Conquer

3. **Insertion Sort**

   - Time Complexity: O(n¬≤)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Type: Comparison Sort

4. **Selection Sort**

   - Time Complexity: O(n¬≤)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Type: Comparison Sort

5. **Bubble Sort**

   - Time Complexity: O(n¬≤)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Type: Comparison Sort

6. **Heap Sort**

   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Type: Comparison Sort

7. **Radix Sort**

   - Time Complexity: O(nk)
   - Space Complexity: O(n+k)
   - Type: Non-comparative Sort

8. **Counting Sort**
   - Time Complexity: O(n+k)
   - Space Complexity: O(n+k)
   - Type: Non-comparative Sort

### Searching Algorithms

1. **Binary Search**

   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
