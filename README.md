## 🔄 Algorithms Explained

### Sorting Algorithms
1. **Merge Sort**
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
   - Space Complexity: O(n)
   - Type: Divide and Conquer

2. **Quick Sort**
   - Time Complexity: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst
   - Space Complexity: O(log n)
   - Type: Divide and Conquer

3. **Insertion Sort**
   - Time Complexity: O(n²)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Type: Comparison Sort

4. **Selection Sort**
   - Time Complexity: O(n²)
   - Space Complexity: O(1)
   - Type: Comparison Sort

### Searching Algorithms
1. **Binary Search**
   - Time Complexity: O(log n)
   - Requires: Sorted array

2. **Linear Search**
   - Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Works with: Any array

## 🛠️ Future Developments
- Implementation of additional algorithms:
  - Heap Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Shell Sort
